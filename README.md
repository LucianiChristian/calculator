# Learning Outcomes
<h3>Project Handling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : I maintained a much improved Notion log to navigate my way through the project. I cannot imagine doing it any other way at this point.</li>
  <li>Insight #1 : I have found that it's not JUST about planning the entire project beforehand. Especially at my low level of experience, I cannot anticipate and conceptualize everything necessary. Rather, it's about making an initial mapping of the project with the expectation that I will encounter new information along the way. Information that will require me to make new models and entertain new possiblities.</li>
  <li>Insight #2 : I have pinned down two fundamental questions that keep me on track and poised. Two questions that I often realize I cannot answer yes to, thus snapping me out of an unskilled mindstate. If either answer is a no, I can be certain I am wandering off, on my way to being lost and frustrated.
    <ol>
      <li>What EXACTLY am I doing? </li> 
      <li>Was this action set beforehand? </li>
    </ol>
 </li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice :  In this project I made extensive use of a console.log() testing function. This was vital in fixing issues with calculator state transitions and decimal flag setting. </li>
  <li>Insight : Keeping all functions commented with clear explanations may seem excessive, but it allows me to view the program on a higher-level. This removes the need for my mind to translate code when scanning over the program, and frees up its entire capacity to think about program logic.</li>
</ul>
